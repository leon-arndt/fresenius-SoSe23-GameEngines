    contents: Yaoharneth-Lahai is the god of little dreams and fancies.  All night
      he sendeth little dreams out of Pegana to please the people of Earth.  He sendeth
      little dreams to the poor man and to The King.  He is so busy to send his dreams
      to all before the night be ended that oft he forgetteth which be the poor man
      and which be The King.
