    contents: To whom Yoharneth-Lahai cometh not with little dreams and sleep he
      must endure all night the laughter of the gods, with highest mockery, in Pegana. 
      All night long Yoharneth-Lahai giveth peace to cities until the dawn hour and
      the departing of Yoharneth-Lahai, when it is time for the gods to play with
      men again.  Whether the dreams and the fancies of Yoharneth-Lahai be false
      and the Things that are done in the Day be real, or the Things that are done
      in the Day be false and the dreams and the fancies of Yoharneth-Lahai be true,
      none knoweth saving only MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, who hath not spoken.
